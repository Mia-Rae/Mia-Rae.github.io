# Mias GitHub.io page

This page is made so I can share my knowledge from my PKM (using Obsidian.md). 
This will probably be mostly about programming, PKM and journalling, as well as DnD notes for my party.

This project is still WIP so it currently only has my DnD notes.


## Building
1. Clone this repo to the same folder that the obsidian vault (named "Knowledge") is in
2. (If not already) create venv & install obsidian-html
    - `python3 -m venv venv`
    - `source venv/bin/activate`
    - `pip install --upgrade pip`
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `convert.sh`, this will convert and then start a preview in a local webserver
4. commit & push changes
