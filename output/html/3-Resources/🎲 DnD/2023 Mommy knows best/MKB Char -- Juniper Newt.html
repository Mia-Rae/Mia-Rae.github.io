<ul>
<li>I am catgirl can shift into full cat for up to 1min   </li>
<li>bard / school lore: know shit; wants truth and knowledge and is ethical   <ul>
<li>chaotic good   </li>
<li>high tech home town   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>charisma and dexterity are most important   <ul>
<li>I'll be doing a lot of the talking   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>best at   </p>
<ul>
<li>persuasion   </li>
<li>insight (knowing others intentions)   </li>
<li>deception &amp; stealth   </li>
<li>performance  <br />
<br>   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>idk who my parents are</strong>, but it was probably <strong>either human + tabaxi or human + cat god</strong> or some deal with a diety, I am not sure, it's just my best guess   </p>
</li>
<li><strong>grew up in community</strong> that worships <strong>cats as god-likes</strong> (kinda like cows in india), as I am bard I <strong>learned to abuse it with my shifting abilities into their god form</strong>   <ul>
<li>might <strong>not know origin story of this ability</strong>, I just fingured out how to do it as a kid, most people didnt have this   </li>
<li>so I <strong>learned to persuade and decieve</strong> others from early on as a kid, having this weird ability   </li>
<li>usually using it to <strong>get attention and food or whatever</strong>   </li>
<li><strong>people dont know is me doing this</strong>, until I am teen and <strong>fuck up by taking it to far</strong>   <ul>
<li>Eventually people <strong>figured out my shenenigans</strong> and I had to <strong>run away</strong>? Why else am I travelling   <ul>
<li>(watch the video again)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which means I am <strong>VERY community / comune / cult / group oriented</strong> but I lost my belonging, now having this <strong>intense need to be part of a group</strong> that is unfulfilled   <ul>
<li>which makes me <strong>kinda insecure</strong> (but I try and cover it up), <strong>overcompensating</strong> by being nice usually, kinda performing and being a people pleaser to compensate too, makeing people like me   </li>
<li>which kinda makes me not only a <strong>shifter in physical form, but also in personality</strong>   </li>
<li>but it also means that every time I do have that <strong>feeling of beloning</strong> even a little bit I move heaven and earth for those people (maybe even to my own detriment)   </li>
<li>this also means I have a huge character flaw: I can be tempted with true belonging, as I crave to be part of a group so much again   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am good at entertaining but not amazing, also not my fave, I just <strong>crave contributing to my group commune again</strong> <br />
<br>   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>background of my community   </p>
<ul>
<li>strong sense of collectivism and serving the groups needs, strong ethics (focus on doing good as ex slaves maybe? are we runaway descendends?), selflessness   </li>
<li>is <strong>isolated/self-contained</strong> from other places and religions and global politics -&gt; this means I kinda dont have a clue whats going on outside as much (but I have started to learn), leading to clumsy stuff (eg. <strong>not aware of customs and other interaction rules sumtimes</strong>)   </li>
<li>I am <strong>kinda reserved actually</strong>, but act all open cause I want attention and belonging, even tho I hide my true self a bit (also masks the pain of not belonging rn)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do I get to the city where the game starts then?   <ul>
<li>well I <strong>ran away and have been traveling</strong>   </li>
<li><strong>strong sense of belonging needed, and I heard big is possible there, so my innermost desire led me to come there in search of belonging</strong>   </li>
<li>but I <strong>kinda got stranded, making money as entertainer</strong> (because thats waht I know best), still kinda looking for a cause and commune to join in my time off   <ul>
<li><strong>not really popular</strong>, no one is gunna recognise me   </li>
<li>which also means I am <strong>not really well off</strong>   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>they are <strong>kinda the technological</strong> (think medival solarpunk plus magic? treating both nature and magic like science but also kinda holy at the same time) socialist communist utopia ... with cats ... (or at least that is what I remeber, who knows if thats actually true)</li>
