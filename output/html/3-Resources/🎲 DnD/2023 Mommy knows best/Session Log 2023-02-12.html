We are told: Every person that arrives will receive a medal, but pls dont destroy houses (you will get ejected from the game). We can do whatever but we need to get to the goal; and we got no clue how to steer the giant turtles. We all decide to sign up, as well as <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#ayo-and-her-party">Dermont from Ayo's party</a>. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> tries to find out how to ride: "it works through intuition for me", <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#resuk-the-horizon-bag-handler">Resuk the handler</a> says. <br />
We are all assigned a turtle. Their names are:   </p>

</ul>
<p>We also find out they eat dried algeas and grass, small trees and bushes, no meat. They can breath water and air.   </p>
<h4 id="horizon-bag-mirgration">Horizon Bag Mirgration</h4>
<p>People are super excited to watch and are cheering us on. Each of us tries to move their giant turtle to the finish line without taking out houses.   </p>
<p><a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> <br />
Tries to make Lump go, but it tries to throw her off. She tries to hold on, but gets yeeted off, faceplants and gets pretty hurt. After getting up she tries to get back on. But fails so bad the turtle wont let her no more for now. <br />
After a while she tries in Common, Elvish and Silvan to approach her. Lump lowers down and allows her to climb on. She barely manages to climb back on, the turtle trying to stay as calm as possible. <br />
They agree to follow the herd together. Keep following the herd and it works. And works. When they get to the finish line they barely get in. She pets and thanks her turtle before collecting the medal. The turtle seems to really like her :)   </p>
<p><a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a> <br />
Cassdey seems to trust and they trot off. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a> wants to follow the path, but Turtle doesnt, they stop until they find agreement. Finally he convinced the turtle, but it is now off the path and is overcompansating, getting lost.  <br />
They finally get back on path after taking an extra loop. Tries to now follow <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> making good progress. It works perfectly. But the turtle gets distracted by Goblins and Gnomes talking to it and feeding it. It seems to understand their language. He finally gets the turtle convinced and she continues on the finish line. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#resuk-the-horizon-bag-handler">Resuk</a> gives medal but seems concerned. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a> reassures. Gets medal too.   </p>
<p><a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> <br />
Tries to convince turtle to wait for now. Talks to her in Sylvan but gets stuck. <br />
Eventually. they go on but down the bottom, away from everyone, taking a shortcut. And they get to the finish line. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#resuk-the-horizon-bag-handler">Resuk</a> is so happy and <strong>gifts a medallie, medal of horizonbag, if hit (reaction or opportunity) may use reaction to +5 AC until next own turn, one time use</strong>; the medal is from a late turtle.    </p>
<p><a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a> <br />
We continue after Killdth. I rename it "Trabby", as it's trotting along v well. But we get stuck behind <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a>, so we cannot move. We try to take a shortcut, but follow <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a> in the entirly wrong direction. Whoops.  <br />
We follow the path and got back to the start. Oops. Noticing this didnt work, I try leading it. I dont really make it work. It goes to rest right where we started. Great. <br />
I try again to motivate it. It is pissed but seems to run off in the right direction. She angy now, but we make progress and finally get to the finish line. I get a medal too.   </p>
<p><a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#ayo-and-her-party">Dermont from Ayo's party</a> <br />
Almost gets yeeted off, he barely hangs on but stays in place, not moving forward. He tries to go to her head and says <em>something</em>, now they be trotting off in record speed. They be making good progress, as he talks to the head. Finishes so quick. Gets a medal, too. He dismounts and sits on floor trying to calm himself.   </p>
<p>After this we finally collect all back together. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> heals <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a>s wounds from falling. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> tries to ask if you can get eggs of the turtles, as the creatures fascinate her. But <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#resuk-the-horizon-bag-handler">Resuk</a> gets deeply offended as they are as intelligent as humans and he hates the suggestion of even owning such a being! That would be equivalent to slavary!   </p>
<h4 id="the-lost-amulet-from-the-underwater-caves">The lost Amulet from the Underwater Caves</h4>
<p>We walk back to the big tent with stage and get ready to present the medals. <br />
After some time guests arrive, <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#leylas-kryn-the-nation-and-city-leader">Leylas Kryn, the nations leader</a> and <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#elder-ushru-from-the-bottle-challange">Elder Ushru</a> are on stage. We are asked to join them. There is a suprise quest: We have to get to the boats soon, but still have an hour. And don't know what to expect. We have an hour to prepare to head off.   </p>
<p><a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> wants to mingle in the crowds. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a> wants to check the stores. In the end we decide to rest at the boats. Where we meet the    </p>

<p>We all get to the boat eventually and head off. It's a tini tiny island. <br />

We are told we may challenge the other team. But if we do then we can get 200 gold instead of 100 gold per Person. We will also get a underwater-breathing potion that lasts 1h. The entire challenge will be underwater. <br />
<a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a> talks to Ayos team and makes a promise we will save each other to make sure we will not drown. They agree and we try and exchange knowledge.  <br />
We drink the potions and wait to get the info. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#elder-ushru-from-the-bottle-challange">Elder Ushru</a> explains: we gotta retrieve a <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#history-of-radiant-citadel-city-and-the-amulet">Amulet</a> from the depths. There may only be one winner.   </p>
<p>It begins: one cave is leading underwater. There is no natural light. We go in. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> creates light with her magic for us. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> says to trust him lead the way. We do.   </p>
<p>We dive in. Down into a 20ft deep cove with dense, very dense kelp forest blocking most of our vision, we cannot see the bottom. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> tries locate but cant find it. So we split up and explore the first cave, find the way to move on. We come to a Y split, we continue south, passing a door. <br />
We are now 40ft down, but we can see a crack with light beams entering the water. Other side is collapsed and inaccessible. We continue on, but the walls collapse further, stray rocks hit <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> and <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a>. They seem to be fine. We find a way through those loose rocks. And find a potion of healing, scroll of thunderwave lying under them. <br />
We move on to next cavern, deep, deep down. Find a white pillar with lil piranha fishies, that seem to be attracted to any movement. We try and distract, but they notice <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> and <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a>, attacking them. We kill them with minimal damage with <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a> holding onto <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a>'s paw, as he's blind.   </p>
<p>Continuing on we find a <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">female halfling</a> in the water that is unaware of us. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a> goes to check it out. She seems almost dead, but alive. There is sumthing dark behind the column behind her. We try and make her notice us. She points at the column, a severed human arm is floating in the water.  <br />
We try and move her. A shark appears. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> tells her to move up to the air pocket. While we fight. <br />

It comes for her, hits. She drops unconscious. We continue fighting while trying to save her. Soon, <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> revivers her, tho shes still pretty hurt. She lives!! <br />
We continue fighting. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a> throws (now very hurt) <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> a potion of healing, which he uses promptly as well as healing himself, too. He's tanking. After a v long and scary fight we finally kill it. Halfway through <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">the halfling</a> started helping us eventually, she seems freindly. As it's dying, the shark swims into the pillar, collapsing part of the structure, revealing another cave entrance.   </p>
<p>While <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a> go look after <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">the halfling</a>, the other three venture forth.

He takes the <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#history-of-radiant-citadel-city-and-the-amulet">Amulet</a>. <br />
Moving on, they discover a forest after the hole with a fruit tree and waterfall. It seems like an exit. <br />
They return to look after the origin of the shark, finding a half-eaten body, similar clothing as <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">the halfling</a>.   </p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a> is with the halfling. She's freaking out, wanting to exit as fast as possible. She has a map for the exit. I cant convince her. So I follow her through the hole, meeting the rest of the party currently coming back to us.   </p>
<p>We together make it through the hole again and find our way out. There is waterfalls and (seemingly religious) statue. The halfling asks for the <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#history-of-radiant-citadel-city-and-the-amulet">Amulet</a> and puts it around the neck of the statue. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> starts praying as it's her god. <br />
The halfling introduces her as <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">üè∞ MKB Campaign Notes#Lula the Rescue from Underwater Caves</a>. She says that the <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#history-of-radiant-citadel-city-and-the-amulet">Amulet</a> is bad and needs to be hidden or destroyed. She and her friend tried to exchange it. Says she is being followed after touching it at the library of <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#radiant-citadel-city">the Radiant Citadel</a>. "Nothing good happens. It makes you know things." She begs to not be exposed "to the people above". <br />
<a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> wants to know what it makes you know. Instead of explaining, she offers him to touch it. As he does, he sees and feels horrible things. He understands suddenly: He feels connected to <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#radiant-citadel-city">Radiant Citadel</a> and feels intense loneliness. He regains conciseness, on his knees from the strong visions and feelings.   </p>
<p>She says she is being hunted now. Because she has seen this too.   </p>
<p>The other competitors of this challange are now also coming close, as we can hear them approaching. We are saying we found the <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#history-of-radiant-citadel-city-and-the-amulet">Amulet</a>. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">Lula</a> tries to hide herself. She still has the "original" <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#history-of-radiant-citadel-city-and-the-amulet">Amulet</a> with the magical powers. While <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> has the fake <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">Lula</a> tried to switch. <br />
We make the plan to get everyone to leave while hiding <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">Lula</a>. We try and get them to leave, while <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> &amp; <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a> stay back for <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">Lula</a>.    </p>
<p>They, together with the competitors given up now knowing they lost, find the way back noticing they are on another island entirely.   </p>
<p>Meanwhile, back with <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">Lula</a>, we are ask about <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#history-of-radiant-citadel-city-and-the-amulet">Amulet</a> &amp; story. Before we leave she lets us know how to find her friends in the future. We are to find a fortune teller and use the keyword "was sind die √úberzugsgeb√ºhren". She keeps the <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#history-of-radiant-citadel-city-and-the-amulet">Amulet</a>. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> also touches the stone, seeing the same person dying(?)/suffering in the vision and realising it's the person the <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#radiant-citadel-city">Radiant Citadel</a> was built for.   </p>
<p><a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a> uses a disguise kit to hide <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">Lula</a> as a familiar. She's so small it works great. We sneak her out.   </p>
<p>They were already waiting for us when we finally all come out. We are all transported back to <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#radiant-citadel-city">Radiant Citadel</a>, waiting for the final ceremony and the promised rewards (200gp per person for retrieving the amulet, as well as the still unknown reward for finishing first in the six challanges.) <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#lula-the-rescue-from-underwater-caves">Lula</a> still has the dusgise pack (which we will get back later). But for now it's time to rest here, back in <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#radiant-citadel-city">Radiant Citadel</a>.</p></div>
