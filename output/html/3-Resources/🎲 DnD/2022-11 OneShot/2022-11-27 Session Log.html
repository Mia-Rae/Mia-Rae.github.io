<hr />
<h4 id="backstory">Backstory</h4>
<p>The adventurers met a while ago. Forming a functional alliance as they were running low on funds. <br />
 They had been travelling a while looking for work, and are now coming across a small village in a magical Forest. Almost as if the fog had let them there intentionally.   </p>
<h4 id="entering-the-small-village">Entering the small village</h4>
<p>They decided to head to the tavern to look for work and a place to sleep. Greeted by "Beer 3 silver", the party also noticed a barkeep, a (seemingly disinterested) taverns owner, and a very distressed kenku. Doing cleaning work; after a bit of haggling the adventurers had found a place to stay the night and were pointed to Mother Hagel, the village founder, for work. <br />
 Children are going missing, the village is cursed with nightmares and even food goes bad in mere hours, they learned from Mother Hagel, asking them to please investigate and return with information or even a plan to rescue the children. She was suggesting her old acquaintance, Giselda, might be involved and that she had a place south of the village through the forest. <br />
 After checking in on the warehouse and the library (where the elves met a very scary humanlike magical bookkeeper) the party rested for the night and then headed off early in the morning, forgetting to return the borrowed books.   </p>
<h4 id="navigating-the-forest">Navigating the Forest</h4>
<p>The fog was heavy, disorienting. Unsettling the dwarfs but leaving the forest elves chill, they made  their way south at a good pace, until the forest became alive, glistening with magic. Eventually, old, massive trees started attacking the adventurers. <br />
 At first, they kept walking, seemingly at the same speed the trees did. And while the elves note how easily they could escape, the dwarves couldn't shake feeling trapped in that forest, with no escape. Deciding to attack the trees with their blunt hammers in panic. <br />
 Turns out, massive trees are massive. And hammers are not axes. Luckily Rurik quickly drew his hand axes, and Naesteria thinking fast, trying fire magic to set the forest ablaze, angering the trees even more. The trees quickly closed in on Naesteria and whacked her with the massive branches. She barely escaped from many, many fainting blows. <br />
 Quickly Vaeltae, clumsily trying to get her arrow lit to join the fight, used her magic healing to save Naesteria from harm. Legends say she never landed a single shot, as she accidentally burned all of her arrows down, or lost them fumbling to cast healing spells. Nobody was quite sure, all they knew was, that there were no arrows to ever be seen again in her quiver. <br />
 Luckily, the party prevailed through their chaotic but surprisingly effective teamwork, and pressed on to the upcoming clearing.   </p>
<h4 id="giseldas-hideout">Giseldas Hideout</h4>
<p>The party is exiting onto a clearing into a small but tidy farmland for medicinal planks. Hidden and locked with magic, a small hatch in the field was found and unlocked. Inside hiding a crazy, old witch, working a cauldron; as well as a scared kenku baby. Noticing the intruders, the witch panicked, threatening to harm the child if the travelers did not leave immediately. <br />
 Fearing the safety of the child the party came up with the plan to invisiblise Vaeltae, who then is to sneak in search for clues on the other children and rescue them, but when she actually entered she forgot the plan, got distracted by the cauldron and then ran away gabbing the one child she could see along with her; the witch's dog chasing after <br />
 Back upstairs, Vaeltae insisted the dog may not be harmed, as the party miserably failed to handle the dog. Rurik, losing patience and moving in to knock the dog out, slips and face plants rights before it. Just in time when Vaeltae finally manages to calm the dog, and mentions she forgot to check for the other two children; meanwhile the kenku baby is chirping in distress <br />
 Rurik hurries down the stairs to reason with the witch, while she tries to charm him; while Naesteria tries to calm the baby. After casting a protecting spell onto the baby, Veit joins Rurik in an attempt to convince the witch to give up, but instead finding a witch unable to reason with, the conversation escalating. Naesteria hands the calm baby back to Vaeltae, then joining Rurik and Veit just in time to see the scene escalate. The witch, her floating sword and the quickling attack. <br />
 Vaeltae, trying to tie the dogs collar to a post, hears screams from the hideout. She proceeds to hurry down the stairs, trying to help or heal, not realising she is still carrying a baby, only to notice a quickling flying overhead, almost knocking her over. When the party realise Vaeltae still has the baby, they yell to get it to safety and join the damn fight; After casting healing words from the cover of the remaining steps, Vaeltae retreats and ties the baby to the dog. <br />
 In those moments the party down in the hideout is having a vicious fight, trying to overpower the witch, but not kill her, as they have not found the remaining children, yet. Rurik manages to knock her down and eventually tie her. Tho she still tries to charm them into letting her go. <br />
 Finally, Vaeltae comes down the stairs, ready to fight and heal, only to realise the fight is already over. Viet, supported by Rurik, starts to question the witch, only to realise she has already sacrificed the other children. After healing the wounds of her party members, Vaeltae decides to check up on the dog and baby, while the rest of the party search the hideout, and question the witch for treasures. <br />
 Meanwhile, the witch finally revealed her pact with the arch fey, exchanging lifeenergy for power and wealth. After additional dwarfquestioning, the party discovered a secret hatch under the bed to a room with magic treasures inside. Eager to grab the spoils of victory, Viet was stopped last second by Rurik, wondering if these highly power magic items might be cursed or dangerous. Which the witch later confirmed. So the items were left behind, the witch tied up and gagged, and the hideout locked. The party had decided to head back to Mother Hagel with the witch, and proof found by Naesteria rummaging through the work benches. <br />
 Upstairs, Vaeltae was making freinds with a very confused dog, deciding to rescue it and take it with her back to the village. Handing Naesteria the baby for the duration of the trip back to village.   </p>
<h4 id="back-at-the-village">Back at the village</h4>
<p>Naesteria returned the abducted child to the kenku, breaking out in reliev and emotions. The baby later would hand Vaeltae a wooden doll and say "good dog" as a thank you to the party for rescuing her. (Or at least that is what the party things the little baby was trying to communicate.) <br />
 Mother Hagel, visited after, also seemed very thankful, would "take care" of the witch Giselda, and paid the adventurers generously. <br />
 The Elves, still scared of the bookkeeper, returned the borrowed books, before joining everyone in the tavern, while the dwarves had another beer.</p></div>
