The tournament of the grand festival seems like a great opportunity. So she moves to the sign up location, noticing a shady bunny, <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a>, as well as another very open and friendly face, <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a>.

We notice we might be able to cooperate. We all have our different reasons. But we agree, and sign up for the tournament. After we explore the city for a short while together.   </p>
<h4 id="meat-pie-eating-challenge">Meat pie eating challenge</h4>
<p>Back to the festival. The trading hall is covered, there is a strong smell of spiced meat. We send in <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> for the coming meat pie eating challenge. He holds his own and just about wins, as the others wave off in the 2nd and third rounds. He receives a medal of Meat Pies (one time 2xD4+2 HP if bitten as 1 AP).   </p>
<h4 id="maze">Maze</h4>
<p>It continues on at the maze for the next challenge. Sandbags and 3m wall of wood create a maze in the middle of the city. We scout and make a plan. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a> asks for the solution using her magic, but the others are already off by the time she finds out.

So much for the blessing and inspiration. He collects a medal (one-use 1 advantage of wisdom and know path to exit any non-magical path).   </p>
<h4 id="riddles-and-rhymes-challenge">Riddles and Rhymes challenge</h4>
<p>We continue to the Riddles and Rhymes Challange, there are two riddles.   </p>
<p><strong>1st Riddle</strong> <br />
Wooden Box with four metal keys. There is a dragon on the wooden box as a portrait. Metallic dragon. Looks heroic. Covered in aquatic symbols.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bronze, copper, silver and gold. [Farben der Schl√ºssel] <br />
Ancient ones for tales of old <br />
Match the key to the boxes lock <br />
A mistaken choice be gets a shock   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bronze key opens the box, as <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> knows immediately. It's a music box inside.   </p>
<p><strong>2nd Riddle</strong> <br />

We have to choose the right one and do so after long discussion, trying desperately to figure out how.   </p>
<p>We win and receive yet another medal. We are informed that we have won more than two medals. But others seem to have won as well, although they didn't win as much. I go to them and try to drive the wedge in the group of the honest and the cheaters further and get the group to break. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#selisa-agetul-by-meike">Selisa</a> pulls me away before the group implodes. We don't get to see what exactly is happening. But they have massive stress among themselves now at least.   </p>
<p>A trumpet sounds. Announcement: All with 2+ medals must go on to the next challenge.   </p>
<h4 id="arrival-in-jiglow">Arrival in <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#jiglow-city">Jiglow</a></h4>
<p>We arrive and enter a ship. We have time as we travel and decide to take a short rest. We arrive in <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#jiglow-city">Jiglow</a>. We have time to look around. There are quite a lof minority races here. The marketplace resembles a circus, set up with tents and lanterns and a stage. Beings gather around.

But only finds an eel, which she brings into the fenced off area with the promise of food, hoping that it will distract the others and help us if necessary.  <br />
She meets back up with the team. The speech begins. A bronze dragon (high profile politician <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#sholeh-the-city-co-leader">Sholeh</a> from <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#radiant-citadel-city">Radiant Citadel</a>), makes the speech, very popular with the audience. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#leylas-kryn-the-nation-and-city-leader">Leylas</a> Head of the <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#xhorhas-nation-and-kryn-dynasty">Xhorhas Nation and Kryn Dynasty</a> (to which <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#jiglow-city">Jiglow</a> belongs) talks about how racial equality and open-mindedness are important values. It's off to the jetty and we begin:   </p>
<p>A spear is in the water and needs to be removed and then brought back to shore. An eel is swimming around somewhere. A shark breaks through the cordoned off zone, but is shocked by the eel. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#juniper-newt-by-mia">Juniper</a> makes it to the spear and continues.

Fortunately, everyone is well.    </p>
<h4 id="rice-harvest-celebration">Rice harvest celebration</h4>
<p>We run to J5 for the next challenge, only to find flooded rice fields. Beetle and Juice (both goblins) own the fields. They introduce the rice harvest festival: One has to cut rice, one has to collect.  <br />
<a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#veit-ungard-by-kanto">Veit</a> cuts. <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/%F0%9F%8F%B0%20MKB%20Campaign%20Notes.html#kilidh-by-rhage">Kilidh</a> gathers.

They are great and harvest the rice in no time. There are two medals made of dried rice leaves: one time use: 1h no extra movements needed in difficult terrain.   </p>
<p>As we walk back to the market place (J6), Horizon Bags (GIGANTIC turtles) are to be seen, they are being fed. A pretty man is overlooking them. It's the season of the Horizon Bag migration. They are big and loving creatures, we are told. "But last year they had to rebuild 6 houses". There are saddles on them.   </p>
<p><em>The party has a short moment to rest, before <a href="/3-Resources/%F0%9F%8E%B2%20DnD/2023%20Mommy%20knows%20best/Session%20Log%202023-02-12.html">continuing on</a> ...</em></p></div>
